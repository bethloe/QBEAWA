Multiple policies are required to address this global drug gap for three categories of pharmaceutical products: essential drugs, new drugs, and yet-to-be-developed drugs. Policies should combine \"push\" approaches of subsidies to support targeted drug development, \"pull\" approaches of financial incentives such as market guarantees, and \"process\" approaches aimed at improved institutional capacity. Constructive solutions are needed that can both protect the incentives for research and development and reduce the inequities of access.",

Gender-based discrimination in promotions is not simply present across levels of hierarchy but is more intense at higher levels. Empirically, this implies that the relative rates of women being promoted to higher levels compared to men should decline with the level of the hierarchy. This article explores this hypothesis with data from three countries: the United States, Australia, and Sweden. The basic conclusion is that while there is strong evidence for a general gender gap in authority-the odds of women having authority are less than those of men-there is no evidence for systematic glass ceiling effects in the United States and only weak evidence for such effects in the other two countries.",

First, a glass ceiling exists when artificial barriers impede the advancement of women and minorities, and second, these barriers are more severe at higher occupational levels. Third, the glass ceiling must be investigated with longitudinal data, and fourth, a glass ceiling is manifested in increasing inequality over the life course. This paper extended these criteria by conducting a longitudinal analysis of managerial attainment (satisfying the second and third criteria). The presence of artificial barriers was assessed by estimating the salience of race and gender to the process of managerial attainment. Additional estimations showed that the gap in managerial attainment between White men and other groups grew over the life course. Thus, findings from this study do satisfy the Cotter et al. criteria regarding the existence and uniqueness of the glass ceiling. The paper concludes with a call for additional research.",

However, women executives may be facing a second pane of obstruction &amp;ndash; an expatriate glass ceiling &amp;ndash; that prevents them from receiving the foreign management assignments and experience that is becoming increasing critical for promotion to upper management. The responsibility to break the expatriate glass ceiling lies with both female managers and the multinational corporations that utilize expatriates.

We find that the mean gender\r\npay gap in the raw data typically hides large variations in the gap across the wages distribution. We use quantile regression (QR) techniques to control for the effects of\r\nindividual and job characteristics at different points of the distribution, and calculate the part of the gap attributable to differing returns between men and women. We find that, first, gender pay gaps are typically bigger at the top of the wage distribution, a finding that is consistent with the existence of glass ceilings. For some countries gender pay gaps are also bigger at the bottom of the wage distribution, a finding that is consistent with sticky floors. Third, the gender pay gap is typically higher at the top than the bottom end of the wage distribution, suggesting that glass ceilings are more prevalent than sticky floors and that these prevail in the majority of our countries. Fourth, the gender pay gap differs significantly across the public and the private sector wages distribution for each of our EU countries.",

Even so, women&amp;rsquo;s labor force behavior lies at the heart of most explanations of fertility and fertility change, and many nations, both industrialized and developing, have formulated policies based on the inverse association between these two central aspects of women&amp;rsquo;s lives. The association between fertility and women&amp;rsquo;s labor force activity reflects the incompatibility between caring for children and participating in economically productive work that typifies industrialized societies (Weller 1977). Prior to industrialization, work and child rearing tasks could be performed more or less simultaneously. In historical and contemporary preindustrial societies, nonmechanized agricultural tasks and piecework could be combined with child supervision with relatively little danger to the child or marked loss of economic productivity (Degler 1980, Roos 1985, Stycos &amp;amp;Weller 1967). As industrialization proceeded, however, childcare and economically productive work became increasingly incompatible. Today, work sites are usually some distance from home, and work schedules, set by employers, lack the flexibility required by children. The presence",

Two findings are reported: (1) For each of three cohorts, within-cohort effects of being female remained relatively constant over the seven years of the SSE (1982-1989). This suggests that earnings penalties for women engineers result from cohort rather than glass-ceiling effects-that the earnings penalty to women is more a matter of when they started their careers than of how long they have worked. (2) In absolute terms, the earnings penalties for younger cohorts of women qre essentially zero. These findings indicate that multi-cohort longitudinal designs should be used in investigations of the glass-ceiling hypothesis, in particular, and of women's progress in management and the professions, in general.",

However, most research in this realm has investigated capabilities within developed countries, and neglected the context of developing and emerging nations, which are increasingly becoming viable economic entities in global supply chains in their own right. The present study fills this gap and carries out a comparative analysis of competitive capabilities among plants in developing, emerging, and industrialized countries. Basing our arguments on the resource-based view of the firm, we suggest that the influence of competitive capabilities on each other varies among plants in differentially industrialized regions. Specifically, we suggest that, on average, competitive capabilities tend to influence each other to a greater degree in plants in emerging and developing countries compared to industrialized countries. Along similar lines, we suggest that the influence of the four competitive capabilities on performance improvement is manifested more strongly among plants in emerging and developing countries than among plants in industrialized nations. We investigate these contentions with data from 1,211 plants in 21 countries. The results are particularly important for decision makers as they decide on the increasingly global location of their manufacturing operations or the configuration of their global supply chains.

We define four specific criteria that must be met to conclude that a glass ceiling exists. Using random effects models and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we examine gender and race inequalities at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of white male earnings. We find evidence of a glass ceiling for women, but racial inequalities among men do not follow a similar pattern. Thus, we should not describe all systems of differential work rewards as \"class ceilings.\" They appear to be a distinctively gender phenomenon.

Quantile regression techniques are used to control for various characteristics at different points of the wage distributions. Counterfactual decomposition analysis, adjusted for the quantile regression framework, is used to examine if the gap is attributed to gender differences in characteristics, or to the differing returns between genders. The main finding is that a strong glass ceiling effect is detected only in the private sector. A second finding is that the acceleration in the gender gap across the distribution does not vanish even after account is taken of an extensive set of statistical controls. This suggests that the observed wage gap is a result of differences in returns to genders. By focusing only on the mean gender wage gap, substantial variations of the gap will be hidden.",

A large-scale, national survey of Fortune 1000 CEOs and the highest-ranking, most successful women in their companies identified key career strategies used by the women in their rise to the top, and the barriers to advancement they faced in their firms. A startling finding of the study was the disparity in the perceptions of CEOs and the high-ranking women in their firms. The Fortune 1000 CEOs had vastly different perceptions of the organizational and environmental barriers faced by their female employees, and in their companies' progress towards equality in the workplace.",

Existing indices are, however, not appropriate because they do not focus exclusively on gender (in)equality and have not been created to be used at the European level. Therefore a European Union Gender Equality Index is presented in this article. Based on the universal caregiver model as outlined by Fraser (1997), the index is composed of four dimensions: equal sharing of paid work, money, decision-making power and time. With regard to the applied methodology, the index is constructed in such a way that the value indicates the actual distance from a situation of full equality. The empirical results show that full equality is still a long way off. Finland, Sweden and Denmark display the highest overall performance, whereas the southern coun- tries &amp;ndash; Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Spain and Italy &amp;ndash; perform rather poorly.",

Data suggest that institutions and those within them penalize men who appear too committed to their families. Some participants crafted identities for themselves that separated their roles as professor and father while others struggled to reconcile their two roles.

The impact of presence of women managers and a gender equality discourse in a large male-dominated company in Sweden is in focus in this empirical study. Results demonstrate how constructions of management change when awareness of gender inequality increases. Men challenge the norm when questioning the ideology that justifies men's domination in management. At the same time, constructions of masculinity expand to include new equality ideals and consequently add on possibilities for male managers, thus reinforcing the male norm in management. Constructions of women change, as individual women managers are described as superior, but women managers are still seen as deficient and less suitable for management, as belonging to a gendered category. The implications for organizational analysis and organizational work for change are greater awareness of how gender equality (GE), can simultaneously challenge and reinforce the masculine norm in management. The positive construction of women in management does not necessarily challenge the masculine norm in management, unless GE work is linked to challenging the masculine norm as part of the dominant organizational culture.

We demonstrate how these processes are interwoven with assumptions about the 'ideal worker' (cf. Acker 1990; 1992) that organizational members are measured against in management. We argue that the 'ideal worker', even though, in general, a masculine notion, should not be perceived as a universal or as a static category. We suggest that notions of the 'ideal worker' not only vary within different models of work organization, but that they vary across societal contexts. These notions are based on different gender orders (cf. Connell 1987) which penetrate organizational life and become incorporated in different, though predominantly masculine, conceptions. 'Ideal worker' is also not a static category. If we consider gender distinctions and relations in organizations as produced, reproduced and redefined through continuously ongoing social interaction, there is a need to analyze how the notion of the 'ideal worker' evolves in time -- when organizations become subject to change efforts through reforms.

The authors investigate how an ideal-worker norm violation--working anything but full time--affects workers' perception of unfair treatment. The authors assess gender and parental status differences in the relationship. Analyses using Midlife Development in the United States II data reveal that women who violate the norm when they have children perceive greater unfair treatment than women who violate the norm but do not have children in the study period. Men who work anything but full time do not perceive unfair treatment. The authors' findings inform efforts to challenge ideal-worker norms.",

It introduces GM as combining technical systems (monitoring, reporting, evaluating) with political processes (women&amp;rsquo;s participation in decision-making) and considers the ways in which this is compatible with CSR agendas. It examines the inclusion of gender equality criteria within three related CSR tools: human capital management (HCM) reporting, CSR reporting guidelines, and socially responsible investment (SRI) criteria on employee and diversity issues. Although evidence is found of gender equality information being requested within several CSR related reporting frameworks, these requirements are mostly limited in scope, or remain optional elements. The nature and extent of relevant stakeholder opportunities are investigated to explain this unfulfilled potential.",

                    "description":"The political shift toward an economic liberalism in many developed market economies, emphasizing the importance of the marketplace rather than government intervention in the economy and society (Dorman, Systematic Occupational Health and Safety Management: Perspectives on an International Development, 2000; Tombs, Policy and Practice in Health and Safety 3(1):24-25, 2005; Walters, Policy and Practice in Health and Safety 03(2):3-19, 2005), featured a prominent discourse centered on the need for business flexibility and competitiveness in a global economy (Dorman, 2000; Tombs, 2005). Alongside these developments was an increasing pressure for corporate social responsibility (CSR). The business case for CSR - that corporations would benefit from voluntarily being socially responsible - was increasingly promoted by governments and corporations as part of the justification for self-regulation. The aim of the article is to examine more closely the proposition that self-regulation is effective, with particular reference to the business case for workplace equality and safety. Based on a comprehensive literature review and documentary analysis, it was found that current predominant management discourse and practice focusing on diversity and safety management systems (OHSMS) resonate well with a government and corporate preference for the business case and self-regulation. However, the centrality of individual rather than organizational factors in diversity and OHSMS means that systemic discrimination and inherent workplace hazards are downplayed, making it less likely that employers will initiate structural remedies needed for real change. Thus, reliance on the business case in the argument for self-regulation is problematic. In terms of government policy and management practice, the business case needs to be supplemented by strong, proactive legislation, and worker involvement. &amp;copy; 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

While flexible work policies common in other organizations \"accommodate\" individuals, this initiative attempts a broader and deeper critique of the organizational culture. We address two research questions: How does this initiative attempt to change the masculinized ideal worker norm? And what do women's and men's responses reveal about the persistent ways that gender structures work and family life? Data demonstrate the ideal worker norm is pervasive and powerful, even as employees begin critically examining expectations regarding work time that have historically privileged men. Employees' responses to ROWE are also gendered. Women (especially mothers) are more enthusiastic, while men are more cautious. Ambivalence about and resistance to change is expressed in different ways depending on gender and occupational status.",

Using original data from 54 qualitative interviews of predominantly middle class, heterosexual women involved in national mothers' groups, this analysis first finds that whether currently working for pay or not, mothers perceive and label a variety of past employment experiences as discriminatory. This is primarily because in their status as mothers, they are seen as not meeting the ideal worker standard of performance nor as capable as non-mothers by their employers. Mothers report events under the categories of moment of hire, on-the-job, and evaluations/promotions related bias, with on-the-job incidents most common. Second, this analysis builds on previous work that has focused on mothers' extreme reactions such as opting out of work completely and filing lawsuits by mapping out three, intermediate responses to this subjective discrimination: ambivalence, endurance, or confrontation. Endurance was the most frequently deployed response strategy overall and for each of the three categories of discrimination. None of these three strategies, unfortunately, functions to promote broad-based organizational reform that would integrate mothers more equitably into the workplace. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

While various strategies have been used to try to increase the number of women entering engineering education and employment, their success has been limited. At the same time it has been argued that the way gender is &amp;lsquo;done&amp;rsquo; in work can help diminish or increase inequality between the sexes. Using empirical research exploring women engineering students&amp;rsquo; workplace experiences, this article considers how gender performance explains their behaviour and attitudes. Butler implied that doing gender can result in our being &amp;lsquo;undone&amp;rsquo;. This was speciﬁcally found to be the case for the women students in this study, who performed their gender in a particular way in order to gain male acceptance. In doing this they utilized certain coping strategies: acting like one of the boys, accepting gender discrimination, achieving a reputation, seeing the advantages over the disadvantages and adopting an &amp;lsquo;anti-woman&amp;rsquo; approach. These strategies are part of women&amp;rsquo;s enculturation and professionalization in engineering, yet they also fail to value femaleness. In &amp;lsquo;doing&amp;rsquo; engineering, women often &amp;lsquo;undo&amp;rsquo; their gender. Such gender performance does nothing to challenge the gendered culture of engineering, and in many ways contributes to maintaining an environment that is hostile to women.",

Both the Dakar 'Education for All' goals and the Millennium Development goals emphasise two goals, in this regard. These two goals are distinguished as gender parity goals [achieving equal participation of girls and boys in all forms of education based on their proportion in the relevant age-groups in the population] and gender equality goals [ensuring educational equality between boys and girls]. In turn these have been characterised as quantitative/numerical and qualitative goals respectively. In order to consider progress towards both types of goal, both quantitative and qualitative assessments need to be made of the nature of progress towards gender equality. Achieving gender parity is just one step towards gender equality in and through education. An education system with equal numbers of boys and girls participating, who may progress evenly through the system, may not in fact be based on gender equality. Following Wilson (Human Rights: Promoting gender equality in and through education. Background paper for EFA GMR 2003/4, 2003) a consideration of gender equality in education therefore needs to be understood as the right to education [access and participation], as well as rights within education [gender-aware educational environments, processes, and outcomes], and rights through education [meaningful education outcomes that link education equality with wider processes of gender justice]. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

As expected, facilitation contributed substantially and differentially to the prediction of work and nonwork outcomes, over and above the effects of conflict. As predicted, women experienced higher levels of facilitation than men did. Furthermore, results indicate that examining facilitation, in addition to conflict, is especially important to predict the work and home life experiences of women.",

The stretched space co-produced by these mothers and photographs is also a form of stretched time, and it is integrative in complex ways; it contains different kinds of absences which disturb but do not break its cohesion. The paper also discusses why the display of family photographs is done almost exclusively by women.",

                    "description":"The typical American family has changed dramatically since the days of \"Ozzie and Harriet\" and \"Father Knows Best.\" Double-income families are now the rule, and fathers are much more involved in raising the children and cleaning house. Reactions to these changes have been diverse, ranging from grave misgivings to a sense of liberation and new possibility. Groups as diverse as Promise Keepers, the Million Man March, and Robert Bly's mythopoetic men's movement tell us that fathers are important. From the fundamentalist right to the feminist left, opinions about the changing nature of the family--and the consequent rethinking of gender roles--have been vehement, if not always very well-founded. In Family Man, sociologist Scott Coltrane brings a wealth of compelling evidence to this debate over the American family. Drawing on his own extensive research and many fascinating interviews, Coltrane explodes many of the common myths about shared parenting, provides first-hand accounts of men's and women's feelings in two-job families, and reveals some innovative solutions that couples have developed to balance job and family commitments. Readers will find an insightful discussion of precisely how and why family life has changed, what forms it may take in the future, and what new kinds of fathers may be on the horizon. The author firmly places these questions within a broad contextual framework. He provides, for instance, an illuminating history of the family that shows that, far from being a fixed structure, the family has always adapted to changing economic, social, and ideological pressures. And by examining how families operate in a variety of non-industrial societies, he demonstrates that our own notions of gender-specific work and parenting roles are culturally rather than biologically determined, and thus inherently flexible. And indeed these roles are changing. While contemporary American women still perform the bulk of domestic tasks, Family Man gives us decisive evidence that men are becoming increasingly involved in both housework and childrearing. Coltrane argues convincingly that this trend will continue. Given the current economic situation--with two-job households now the norm--and the gradual ideological shift away from restrictive gender roles, more and more couples will find it both necessary and desirable to share the workload. More important, Coltrane suggests that as fathers participate more fully in raising their children and performing traditionally female household tasks, men will themselves be transformed by the experience in profoundly positive ways and American society as a whole will move closer to true gender equity. Family Man succeeds brilliantly in bringing clarity, perspective, and above all hope to a discussion that is too often shrill, chaotic, and beset with the rhetoric of nostalgia. It shows us not only exactly where the family is today, but where it has been and what it may become.",

                    "description":"We argue that in the Netherlands, due to the growth of part-time work, work norms have declined. The mechanism behind this norm change is in the changed organization of family life. The increased labour market participation of women has put the traditional organization of family life under pressure. Working mothers in the Netherlands opt for part-time jobs, thus sacrificing career opportunities for family life. Working fathers also have to trade-off hours, because a greater contribution to family life is expected from them. This implies that work norms are supported less by both women and men in their redefined roles than in their traditional roles. The hypotheses that follow from this argument are tested in multilevel regression analysis on the OSA Labour Supply Panel surveys for the period 1988-2002. The tests show that part-time working women and their partners adhere less to the work obligation norm than breadwinners and housewives. Adherence to the work obligation norm among parents has decreased with the growth of part-time work. Among non-parents, support for the norm has decreased too, but less than among parents. Our analyses show that, due to the growth of part-time work, the traditional division of labour is no longer predominant, and, as a result, the traditional work ethic is declining.",

It uses measures of both behaviour and attitudes, drawing on two nationally representative Australian data sets, the Bureau of Statistics Time Use Survey and the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia. Women have more responsibility for care than men, but with older children there is greater gender equity in the division of labour, a less pressing domestic burden and less maternal time stress. This occurs because women recalibrate their commitments to work and home, not because domestic labour is redistributed between mothers and fathers. Further, it does not hold if women replace unpaid with paid labour; mothers who work full time have high total workloads and high stress levels regardless of the age of children. Fathers are more satisfied with their work-family balance the more they participate in childcare and the more they feel supported by their workplace to access family-friendly work policies.",

However, these behavior problems may not manifest in a structured environment, such as a school setting. Objective: We determined whether there is an association between PCE and school behavior problems and whether ratings of behavior problems from the teacher differ from those noted by the parent or caretaker. Methods: The Maternal Lifestyle Study, a multicenter study, enrolled 1388 children with and without PCE at one month of age for longitudinal assessment. Teachers masked to prenatal drug exposure status completed the Teacher Report Form (TRF/6-18) when children were 7, 9, and 11. years old. We also administered the Child Behavior Checklist-parent report (CBCL) to the parent/caretaker at same ages and then at 13. years. We performed latent growth curve modeling to determine whether high PCE will predict externalizing, internalizing, total behavior, and attention problems at 7. years of age and whether changes in problems' scores over time differ between those exposed and non-exposed from both teacher and parent report. Besides levels of PCE as predictors, we controlled for the following covariates, namely: site, child characteristics (gender and other prenatal drug exposures), family level influences (maternal age, depression and psychological symptomatology, continuing drug use, exposure to domestic violence, home environment, and socioeconomic status), and community level factors (neighborhood and community violence). Results: The mean behavior problem T scores from the teacher report were significantly higher than ratings by the parent or caretaker. Latent growth curve modeling revealed a significant relationship between intercepts of problem T scores from teacher and parent ratings; i.e., children that were rated poorly by teachers were also rated poorly by their parent/caretaker or vice versa. After controlling for covariates, we found high PCE to be a significant predictor of higher externalizing behavior problem T scores from both parent and teacher report at 7. years (p. = 0.034 and p. = 0.021, respectively) in comparison to non-PCE children. These differences in scores from either teacher or caregiver were stable through subsequent years or did not change significantly over time. Boys had higher T scores than girls on internalizing and total problems by caretaker report; they also had significantly higher T scores for internalizing, total, and attention problems by teacher ratings; the difference was marginally significant for externalizing behavior (p. = 0.070). Caretaker postnatal use of tobacco, depression, and community violence were significant predictors of all behavior problems rated by parent/caretaker, while lower scores on the home environment predicted all behavior outcomes by the teacher report. Conclusions: Children with high PCE are likely to manifest externalizing behavior problems; their behavior problem scores at 7. years from either report of teacher or parent remained higher than scores of non-exposed children on subsequent years. Screening and identification of behavior problems at earlier ages could make possible initiation of intervention, while considering the likely effects of other confounders. &amp;copy; 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We report data from respondents (N = 4501) to the Women Physicians' Health Study, a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study of a stratified random sample of US women MDs. RESULTS: Women physicians with children aged 0 to 17 years spent a median of 24.4 hours per week on child care. Women physicians typically spent half an hour per day cooking, and another half-hour per day on other housework. Little time was spent on gardening: a median of 0.05 hours (3 minutes) per week. Those performing more domestic tasks are likely to work fewer hours outside the home and to be on call less often. Women physicians who are married or widowed, have more children, have lower personal incomes, and have more highly educated and higher-earning spouses perform more domestic activities. We found no significant adverse relationship between time spent on any domestic activity and career satisfaction or mental or physical health. CONCLUSIONS: Women physicians spend little time on domestic activities that can be done for them by others, including cooking, housework, and especially gardening. Women physicians spend somewhat less time on child care and substantially less time on housework than do other US women. Despite abundant editorializing about role conflicts of women physicians, our measures of career satisfaction and mental health were not adversely affected by time spent on domestic obligations.",

One percent random samples of the Hong Kong census and by-census data from the period 1981-2001 were used, and domestic workers are conceptualized as substitutes for wives' domestic labour. Hypotheses are tested, which alternatively conceptualize domestic workers as substitutions for wives' domestic labour, and as having symbolic functions for the family household and for the wives' gender role. The presence of live-in domestic workers significantly increases the odds of mothers (but not non-mothers) being economically active. The effects of domestic workers on the odds of whether married women work vary over time and differ according to household income and wives' educational attainment. Findings lend support to the symbolic functions of domestic workers and to the role of lifestyle preferences in women's employment. Further research using time budget, qualitative and attitudinal data are required in order to further understand the functions of domestic workers in the social reproduction of family and gender roles",

We replicated and extended previous research demonstrating that perceptions of heterosexual and same-sex domestic violence are generally consistent with gender-role stereotypes. Male and female undergraduates read one of four domestic abuse cases varying by victim and perpetrator sex and sexual orientation. Victim sex, rather than sexual orientation, was the most potent predictor of responses, although male-against-female violence was considered the most serious and deserving of active intervention. Domestic violence perpetrated by men or against women was judged more serious than violence perpetrated by women or against men. Perceptions that male perpetrators were more capable of injuring victims, and female victims were more likely to suffer serious injury were consistent with gender-role stereotypes.

In Chile, the expansion of the credit system has had a double-edged effect on the poor. Although it produces perpetual indebtedness, it also is a resource amid unstable labor. Following an extended family over several years, this article examines how women take up credit through a wider field of domestic relations and institutions to care for kin with mental illness and addiction within the home. Such gestures of care enact a temporality of waiting, allowing different, but unpredictable, aspects of others to emerge. Through longitudinal ethnographic research with this family, I demonstrate both how possibility is actualized within the home as symptoms of illness and forms of domestic violence, and how a wider network of dependencies&amp;mdash;from neighbors to lending institutions&amp;mdash;shapes the temporality of relations within the home. Such a study of care in relation to the credit economy may offer other analytic perspectives on discourses of individualism, consumerism, and cost-effectiveness accompanying the expansion of consumer credit as they are absorbed into the everyday.",

This article deals with a strategy to cope with remaining domestic duties; to what extent are domestic tasks outsourced, what are the main determinants, and does it indeed save time spent on housework? Five outsourcing options are investigated: domestic help, take-out meals, the microwave, the dishwasher, and the dryer. Hypotheses are formulated with respect to household resources, time availability, demand, and adaptability to new appliances. These hypotheses (except the adaptability hypothesis) assume that outsourcing saves time. This underlying assumption is tested as well. Using time budget data of the Dutch population in 1995, results show that especially households with higher incomes and double earners more often make use of all kinds of outsourcing options. Furthermore, the domestic help as well as the dishwasher saves time for women, whereas the microwave is time saving for men.",

Drawing on those major life-cycle trends, this study tests hypotheses that link variation in husbands' and wives' participation in housework to stages of the family life cycle. We expected that women would spend less time in housework before and after childbearing stages, while their husbands would spend more time in domestic labor during periods of least occupational involvement, that is, early in their employment career and after retirement. Multiple regression was used to analyze the housework time of 1,618 white couples from the 1976 wave of the Panel Study of In- come Dynamics. Findings from this analysis are generally consistent with our hypotheses in that the salience of work and family roles affects the respective amounts of time that spouses allocate to household labor. Finally, our results raise broader concerns regarding the measurement of role sharing and the recent conceptual emphasis on the family work day.",

Previous research explained the use of domestic help mainly in terms of financial and time constraints. In this article, we conceptualize household work as producing not only goods but also direct utility, and we argue that the more pleasure household members take in doing domestic work, the less they outsource it. Using the Dutch Time Competition Survey (N = 736), we find that if partners enjoy maintenance, cleaning, cooking, or child care, they are less likely to outsource these tasks, controlling for time and monetary resources and gender-role expectations. A woman's preferences are more important for the outsourcing of cleaning and child care, whereas a man's preferences are more important for the outsourcing of home maintenance. Cooking is less likely to be outsourced when both men and women find it pleasurable to cook themselves.",

Some of the inconsistency in this research may stem from the conceptual confusion surrounding the concepts of role overload and role conflict. This study clarifies these concepts in order to examine their effects on stress-related outcomes. A model is tested which specifies that role overload (e.g., domestic and paid work time expenditures) and role conflict (e.g., perceptions of work-family interference) affect satisfaction with various role domains (e.g., job satisfaction and marital satisfaction) which in turn influences stress (e.g., psychophysical symptoms and well-being). Covariance structure models are estimated for employed, currently married women and men. As expected, marital and job satisfaction strongly affect both psychophysical symptoms and well-being. Findings also suggest that role conflict decreases both sexes' job satisfaction and men's marital satisfaction and increases women's psychophysical symptoms. Role overload does not affect role satisfaction or stress for either sex. It is concluded that perceived role conflict decreases women's psychological health, but role overload does not.

A crucial consideration under the TRIPS compuls- ory licensing option is the &lsquo;adequate remuneration&rsquo; paid. A theoretical and empirical analysis shows that the royalties set under past compulsory licenses have been much lower than those that would be established under the &lsquo;fore- gone profits&rsquo; standard of US patent law. To respect comparative advantage in the supply of licensed drugs, the TRIPS language requiring that compulsory licensing be predominantly for domestic supply needs clarification. The mul- tinational drug pricing strategy that best combines equity with coverage of R&amp;D costs is a variant of Ramsey pricing, under which prices are much lower in nations with low ability to pay and/or high price elasticities of demand than in wealthy nations. Statistical evidence on the prices of 15 AIDS drugs in 18 low- and medium-income nations reveals that tendencies toward Ramsey pricing were at best weak. To encourage Ramsey pricing, parallel exports should be barred from low-income nations, and price controls should not benchmark the prices charged in low-income nations. Outright donation can also enhance the supply of drugs to low-income nations. A quantitative ana- lysis shows that when the marginal cost of production is low relative to &lsquo;inventoriable&rsquo; average cost, donations can actually enhance a drug producer&rsquo;s after-tax profits under US tax laws. Minor tax law changes to enhance dona- tion incentives are suggested.",

Yet in recent decades, women in some countries and regions of the world have made significant gains in legislative presence at the national level. But for women living outside of the industrialized West, we know little about the processes that facilitate their entry into politics. Through separate analyses of 36 high-income, 86 middle-income, and 63 low-income countries, I demonstrate that past models of women's political representation fail to explain variation across low-income samples. Using multiple methods, I also explore two sets of factors that may be more salient predictors of women's parliamentary representation in low-income nations: civil war and international linkages. Although historically women have been unable to consolidate gains made during wartime into post-conflict political representation, I find that certain types of civil conflict during the 1980s and 1990s positively affect women's representation in low-income nations. Longer, larger-scale wars that contest the political system or serve to alter the composition of the government have the best prospects for creating opportunities for women to gain parliamentary seats. Brief case studies of women, war, and social change in Rwanda, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tajikistan suggest that structural and cultural mechanisms may work in conjunction with political openings to produce post-conflict gains in women's political presence. Both women's lack of political representation and the tragic effects of civil war remain enduring challenges faced by the developing world, but at the intersection of these two problems, there is hope for women seeking political access. &copy; 2009 by Society for the Study of Social Problems, Inc.

In this paper, we examine whether and in what manner political risk affects FDI and compare its different effects in developing and developed economies. Using the 12 category Political Risk Index compiled by the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG), we find the following: First, political risk is a significant determinant of FDI in both industrialized and developing nations. Second, not all aspects of political risk affect FDI stocks in industrialized and developing countries in the same way. When we compare the effects of different political risk component, we find that since the 9/11 attacks, political risks have become more important and significant determinants of FDI flows, especially in industrialized nations.",

The author discusses whether the\ninhospitable occupational climate in industrialized nations is\nrelatively advantageous for women scientists when compared to the Third\nWorld, where women may be especially vulnerable to deleterious\nscientific conditions exemplified by less developed nations and\ncharacterized by weak research infrastructures, a lack of\nanti-discriminatory legislation, fewer mentors, and capricious access to\nthe educational foundation necessary to enter scientific careers. In\nexamining the data, however, the analysis provides support to the\ncontrary; women scientists actually have adapted in highly advantageous\nways in less developed nations based upon measures capturing presence in\nthe workplace, mentoring relationships, the potential for network\ncollaborations, and resource expectations. The author extends social\nDarwinism paradigms to explain the unexpected phenomenon through her\nEvolutionary Adaptation Model, and recommends that feminine patterns of\nscientific contributions in the Third World be explored in greater\ndetail in order to identify adaptation patterns and institutional\nconditions that strengthen the potential contributions of female\nscientists at all levels of economic development",

We posit that developing countries, when compared to technologically and economically more mature developed countries, are adopting Microblogging services such as Twitter at a significantly greater and relative rate than Social Networking Services such as Facebook. This assertion is supported using a Z test comparing the proportions of users for each service type in each country type surveyed. If the observed pattern continues it will have important implications to firm's intent on communicating marketing messages using so called Web 2.0 applications and services in these highly sought after new growth markets",

The point of departure of this discourse is that women and men are different and that there is congruence between men and managerial jobs. On the basis of a qualitative study of women managers, I argue that there is a need for more sophisticated ways of appreciating the experiences of (many) women in relation to management. Variation, complexity and contradictions may be lost when holding onto essentialist understandings such as the male norm.",

Nations considering the legislation followed with the second strongest scores. When level of development was factored in, the e-government measurement strength was still higher, on average, in the countries with access-to-information legislation, but the differences were not as great.",

I find that the \"proximity to gender equality\" constructed from the United Nations' human development and gender-related development indices improves development in the form of both child hunger and child mortality. Extending these results, other forms of female empowerment including female contraceptive prevalence significantly improve development outcomes in less-industrialized societies. Findings are net of theoretical controls for economic development, population pressure, globalization, democratization, and region, further strengthening the importance of gender considerations. Countries that incorporate gender into policy and program considerations benefit from such inclusion in the form of social and economic development outcomes. Findings are an important crossnational extension of existing research, utilizing new measures that capture the important development dynamic. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Although this could be because Internet penetration stimulates exports, it could also be because trade openness encourages Internet use. To test the direction of causation, we allow Internet use to be determined endogenously using countries' regulation of data services as an instrument. The results suggest that access to the Internet does improve export performance in developing countries, although not in developed countries. In other words, improving Internet access in a developing country will stimulate exports from that country to rich countries. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",
