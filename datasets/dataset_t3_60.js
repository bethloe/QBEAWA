        "text": "In all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought. Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark,[20] play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution which preceded and financed the Renaissance.",

Conspicuous in a host of disciplines from history of science and technology to history of art, literature, and society, both have assumed a prominent place in studies of the Early Modern period. This volume brings together an international group of scholars to investigate the various manifestations of, and relationships between, 'curiosity' and 'wonder' from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Focused case studies on texts, objects and individuals explore the multifaceted natures of these themes, highlighting the intense fascination and continuing scrutiny to which each has been subjected over three centuries.From instances of curiosity in New World exploration to the natural wonders of 18th-century Italy, Curiosity and Wonder from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment locates its subjects in a broad geographical and disciplinary terrain. Taken together, the essays presented here construct a detailed picture of two complex themes, demonstrating the extent to which both have been transformed and reconstituted, often with dramatic results.",

The rediscovery of the splendour of ancient Greece and Rome marked the beginning of the rebirth of the arts following the break-down of the dogmatic certitude of the Middle Ages. A number of artists began to innovate in the domains of painting, as well as sculpture and architecture.

              "description":"The Renaissance was a cultural revolution that spread from Florence, in 1400, throughout Italy and into the rest of Europe. Its impetus was the philosophy of Humanism, which strove to resurrect and emulate the literature and art of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Artists had previously been limited to formulaic religious iconography. They now began to reproduce descriptions of classical paintings and copy the antique statues that were being newly rediscovered. The Renaissance artist's perception of beauty was therefore determined by his philosophical environment, his visual experience (the 'period eye'), the demands of his patrons and by attempts to enhance his professional status in society to equal that of poets and architects. The image of Venus portrayed by Botticelli as the idealization of beauty in Renaissance Florence is significantly different from the Venus portrayed by the German artist, Lucas Cranach. The northern European Venus is much less voluptuous than her Italian counterpart but is still inspired by humanist principals and retains considerable sexuality. Raphael's paintings epitomise the idealization of female beauty of this period but, by his own admission they were rarely based on real models. Often the same facial type was repeated in many different paintings. Indeed Renaissance portrait artists tended to avoid realistic interpretation, emphasizing instead the positive attributes of their subjects, both physical and political. Thus, Bronzino's Portrait of a Young Man not only depicts his subject's idealized appearance but also his scholarship, background and potential. The depiction of beauty in Renaissance art is shown to be more complex than a mere photograph-like representation of sexuality or of a person's physical appearance. Instead, Renaissance art created physically perfect images resulting from scholarly expectation, the artist's ambitions and his developing skills.",

In his final work, Interpreting the Renaissance, published here in English for the first time, Tafuri analyzes Renaissance architecture from a variety of perspectives, exploring questions that occupied him for over thirty years: What theoretical terms were used to describe the humanist analogy between architecture and language? Is it possible to identify the political motivations behind the period's new urban strategies? And how does humanism embody both an attachment to tradition and an urge to experiment?\" \"Tafuri studies the theory and practice of Renaissance architecture, offering new and compelling readings of its various social, intellectual, and cultural contexts while providing a broad understanding of uses of representation that shaped the entire era. He synthesizes the history of architectural ideas and projects through discussions of the great centers of architectural innovation in Italy (Florence, Rome, and Venice), key patrons from the middle of the fifteenth century (Pope Nicholas V) to the early sixteenth century (Pope Leo X), and crucial figures such as Leon Battista Alberti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Lorenzo de'Medici, Raphael, Baldassare Castiglione, and Giulio Romano.

Revivals and Otherness: some thoughts on the Italian Renaissance as a model of cultural renewal.  A decade ago Peter Burke, a leading historian of the Italian Renaissance, wrote that \"if we of the late twentieth century are to understand the Italian Renaissance, we would be well advised to approach it as an alien, or, at the very least ... as a half-alien culture, indeed one which is receding from us, becoming more alien every year\". Taking this as my starting point, I shall use the idea of alienation and otherness as a means of probing the relevance not only of classical culture to the Italian Renaissance but also of the Italian Renaissance to nineteenth-century writers, as well as to ourselves today. Whether we look at the attitudes of humanists like Petrarch, historians like Machiavelli, artists like Alberti or philosophers like Ficino, what we see after their initial approach to ancient culture as aliens, is appropriation and then apparent rejection - the ancients being \"wrong about many things\", they all eventually admitted. Despite this outward rejection, however, there was longer-term assimilation in areas where the otherness seemed initially most marked and dangerous, to do with the random, fortuitous nature of the world and the changing, protean nature of man. A similar process can be seen at work in the interest of nineteenth-century writers in the Italian Renaissance at another moment of changing beliefs and views about the world, raising in conclusion questions about our own attitude to these revivals today: as they get more distant from us, should we should approach them with increasing detachment as anthropologists, or should we probe more deeply the reasons for our continuing interest in their relevance?

In this magisterial work, Goldthwaite brings together a lifetime of research and insight on the subject, clarifying and explaining the complex workings of Florence's commercial, banking, and artisan sectors. Florence was one of the most industrialized cities in medieval Europe, thanks to its thriving textile industries. The importation of raw materials and the exportation of finished cloth necessitated the creation of commercial and banking practices that extended far beyond Florence's boundaries. Part I situates Florence within this wider international context and describes the commercial and banking networks through which the city's merchant-bankers operated. Part II focuses on the urban economy of Florence itself, including various industries, merchants, artisans, and investors. It also evaluates the role of government in the economy, the relationship of the urban economy to the region, and the distribution of wealth throughout the society.While political, social, and cultural histories of Florence abound, none focuses solely on the economic history of the city. The Economy of Renaissance Florence offers both a systematic description of the city's major economic activities and a comprehensive overview of its economic development from the late Middle Ages through the Renaissance to 1600.",

              "description":"\"Their name is a byword for immense wealth and power, but before their renown as art patrons and noblemen, the Medici built their fortune on banking - specifically, on lending money at interest. Banking in the fifteenth century, even at the height of the Renaissance, meant running afoul of the Catholic Church's prohibition against usury. It required more than merely financial skills to make a profit, and the legendary Medici - most famously Cosimo and Lorenzo (\"the Magnificent\") - were masterly in wielding the political, diplomatic, military, and even metaphysical tools that were needed to maintain their family's position.\" \"Tim Parks uncovers the intrigues, dodges, and moral qualities that gave the Medici their edge. Evoking the richness of the Florentine Renaissance and the Medici's glittering circle, replete with artists, popes, and kings, Medici Money is a look into the origins of modern banking and its troubled relationship with art and religion.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

Between 1400 and 1600, European perceptions of society, culture, politics and even humanity itself emerged in ways that continue to affect not only Europe but the entire world. In this wide-ranging exploration of the Renaissance, Jerry Brotton shows the period as a time of unprecedented intellectual excitement, cultural experimentation, and interaction on a global scale, alongside a darker side of religion, intolerance, slavery, and massive inequality of wealth and status. Brotton skillfully guides us through the key issues that defined the Renaissance period, from its art, architecture, and literature, to advancements in the fields of science, trade, and travel. In its incisive account of the complexities of the political and religious upheavals of the period, the book argues that there are significant parallels between the Renaissance and our own era. This is the first clear and concise account of the Renaissance as a global phenomenon, an important new vision of the Renaissance for the 21st century written by a young Renaissance scholar of a new generation.",

It attempts to sustain the argument that the humanists of the Italian Renaissance first developed a theory of republicanism that accommodated commercial activity and a positive understanding of self-interest. Without this new economic variation on its ancient models, republicanism would not have survived in the modern world. By clarifying the commercial element of Italian city-states and highlighting basic continuities with subsequent republican episodes, the Italian republican experiment reemerges as a pivotal moment in the history of Western political thought.",

Their findings demonstrate the variety and complexity of black African life in fifteenth and sixteenth-century Europe, and how it was affected by firmly held preconceptions relating to the African continent and its inhabitants, reinforced by Renaissance ideas and conditions.

              "description":"Using Savannah, Georgia, as a case study, Sacred Mission, Worldly Ambition tells the story of the rise and decline of Black Christian Nationalism. This nationalism emerged from the experiences of segregation, as an intersection between the sacred world of religion and church and the secular world of business. The premise of Black Christian Nationalism was a belief in a dual understanding of redemption, at the same time earthly and otherworldly, and the conviction that black Christians, once delivered from psychic, spiritual, and material want, would release all of America from the suffering that prevented it from achieving its noble ideals. The study's use of local sources in Savannah, especially behind-the-scenes church records, provides a rare glimpse into church life and ritual, depicting scenes never before described. Blending history, ethnography, and Geertzian dramaturgy, it traces the evolution of black southern society from a communitarian, nationalist system of hierarchy, patriarchy, and interclass fellowship to an individualistic one that accompanied the appearance of a new black civil society. Although not a study of the civil rights movement, Sacred Mission, Worldly Ambition advances a bold, revisionist interpretation of black religion at the eve of the movement. It shows that the institutional primacy of the churches had to give way to a more diversified secular sphere before an overtly politicized struggle for freedom could take place. The unambiguously political movement of the 1950s and 1960s that drew on black Christianity and radiated from many black churches was possible only when the churches came to exert less control over members' quotidian lives.",

But who were these artists, why did they produce such memorable images, and how would their original beholders have viewed these objects? Was the Renaissance only about great masters and masterpieces, or were women artists and patrons also involved? And what about the \"minor\" pieces that Renaissance men and women would have encountered in homes, churches and civic spaces? This Very Short Introduction answers such questions by considering both famous and lesser-known artists, patrons, and works of art within the cultural and historical context of Renaissance Europe. The volume provides a broad cultural and historical context for some of the Renaissance's most famous artists and works of art. It also explores forgotten aspects of Renaissance art, such as objects made for the home and women as artists and patrons. Considering Renaissance art produced in both Northern and Southern Europe, rather than focusing on just one region, the book introduces readers to a variety of approaches to the study of Renaissance art, from social history to formal analysis.",

Talal Asad proceeds to dismantle commonly held assumptions about the secular and the terrain it allegedly covers. He argues that while anthropologists have oriented themselves to the study of the strangeness of the non-European world and to what are seen as non-rational dimensions of social life (things like myth, taboo, and religion),the modern and the secular have not been adequately examined. The conclusion is that the secular cannot be viewed as a successor to religion, or be seen as on the side of the rational. It is a category with a multi-layered history, related to major premises of modernity, democracy, and the concept of human rights.

Both of them are general aspects of social and cultural participation characterizing intellectuals as well as non-intellectuals. These contentions are examined in a study of American-born graduate students. Graduate students are classified into four categories: alienated intellectuals, integrated intellectuals, alienated non-intellectuals, and integrated non-intellectuals. Each category has a somewhat different social profile, different set of ties to non-academic collectivities and the academic community, different value orientations. The analysis suggests that intellectuals' feeling of alienation is not inevitable and that the variation in the intensity of alienation can be explained by the kind of ties the student intellectual establishes with non-academic people and by their reaction to his endeavors.

This study gives particular attention to the volatile moment when pagan culture, revived in the Renaissance liberal arts, confronted Judeo-Christian iconoclasm, revived in the Protestant Reformation. My argument goes beyond iconoclasm's recognized function as religiously-motivated breaking of images to address its potential as a political force, as a theology that defines political spaces and directs political relations. The biblical analogies of marriage/monotheism and adultery/idolatry put the religious subject in a love triangle, vacillating between the violent exhilaration of polymorphous and unconstrained desires, on the one hand, and the stable rewards of law and contract, on the other. In the religious texts I examine, including the Hebrew prophets, Paul, and John Foxe, these analogies always include a political dimension. By embodying all Israel as the \"bride of God,\" the marriage/monotheism analogy incorporates monotheistic subjects into a coherent national body which is settled and domesticated. The adultery/idolatry analogy conceives a threat to the integrity of this body politic in the form of the unsettled foreigner, who can lure the subject away from God's household or attack the political body itself in the pursuit of empire. I examine idolatry and iconoclasm as political performances in three Renaissance tragedies. Tamburlaine's quest for apotheosis as world emperor is sealed and finally destroyed by his idolatrous devotion to a foreign bride; Othello's bid for membership in Christendom through military service and marriage is undermined by his lapses into both idolatrous love and iconoclastic wrath; Samson ironically achieves his act of heroic iconoclasm and redeems his nation from imperial subjugation through intermarriage and intermixture with his idolatrous Philistine enemies. Viewed as a political ideology, iconoclasm helps illuminate the complex web of Greco-Roman, Judeo-Christian, and contemporary secular matter that constitutes English Renaissance drama.",

              "description":"This article is one of the first sociological explorations of power struggles between intellectuals where matters of life and death are literally at stake. It counters the prevailing tendency within sociology to study intellectuals within confined academic institutions where power struggles are limited to matters of symbolic and institutional recognition. This study explores the conflict between collaborationist and Resistance intellectuals at the end of the Second World War in France, and it focuses in particular on the purge of collaborationist intellectuals which culminated in several high profile trials. This article shows that the arguments and meta-arguments put for- ward in these trials led to broader intellectual debates outside the courtroom. These debates not only centred on the notion of the writer&rsquo;s responsibility, but also dealt with anxieties about the disintegrative forces of modern society. Whereas collaborationist intellectuals portrayed their writing as either separate from politics or rescuing a defunct or degenerate nation, Resistance intellectuals such as Jean-Paul Sartre were keen to por- tray collaborators as outsiders, both socially and sexually, lacking in social integration and subservient to a strong external force. The Resistance intellectuals saw the notion of individual responsibility not as antithetical but as integral to the remaking of the French nation, and this concept would become the cornerstone of the reshaping of the intellec- tual landscape in the post-war era in France.",

The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Philosophy provides an introduction to a complex period of change in the subject matter and practice of philosophy. The philosophy of the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries is often seen as transitional between the scholastic philosophy of the Middle Ages and modern philosophy, but the essays collected here, by a distinguished international team of contributors, call these assumptions into question, emphasizing both the continuity with scholastic philosophy and the role of Renaissance philosophy in the emergence of modernity. They explore the ways in which the science, religion and politics of the period reflect and are reflected in its philosophical life, and they emphasize the dynamism and pluralism of a period which saw both new perspectives and enduring contributions to the history of philosophy. This will be an invaluable guide for students of philosophy, intellectual historians, and all who are interested in Renaissance thought.",

In this context, one striking feature of the Egyptian uprising that took place last spring is the extent to which it defied characterization in terms of the religious&ndash;secular binary. In this commentary, I explore how this movement drew sustenance from a unique political sensibility, one disencumbered of the secular versus religious oppositional logic and its concomitant forms of political rationality. This sensibility has a distinct intellectual genealogy within Egyptian political experience. I focus here on the careers of three Egyptian public intellectuals whose pioneering engagement with the question of the place of Islam within Egyptian political life provided an important part of the scaffolding, in my view, for the practices of solidarity and association that brought down the Mubarak regime.

Consequently, during the Precambrian, the smaller size of the inner core might suggest that polarity reversals could occur more readily. It is therefore surprising that there are indications that reversals were rare during this period. Here we use new and existing palaeomagnetic data from three continents to examine the stability of the Earth's magnetic field from 2.82 to 2.45 billion years ago. We show that, on average, geomagnetic secular variation (the field variations produced by normal geodynamo action) during the late Archaean and early Proterozoic was different from that of the past 200 million years; specifically, the apparent variability of the geomagnetic pole as viewed at low and mid-latitudes was reduced relative to the past 200 million years. According to both dynamo simulations and more recent palaeomagnetic field observations, the observed pattern of secular variation suggests a lower frequency of polarity reversals 2.5 billion years ago. This may imply that the geodynamo is becoming progressively less stable over long timescales, consistent with some numerical simulations, possibly as a result of changing outer-core geometry that has accompanied inner-core growth.",

In this gripping biography, Jeremy Adelman tells the story of a man shaped by modern horrors and hopes, a worldly intellectual who fought for and wrote in defense of the values of tolerance and change. Born in Berlin in 1915, Hirschman grew up amid the promise and turmoil of the Weimar era, but fled Germany when the Nazis seized power in 1933. Amid hardship and personal tragedy, he volunteered to fight against the fascists in Spain and helped many of Europe's leading artists and intellectuals escape to America after France fell to Hitler. His intellectual career led him to Paris, London, and Trieste, and to academic appointments at Columbia, Harvard, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was an influential adviser to governments in the United States, Latin America, and Europe, as well as major foundations and the World Bank. Along the way, he wrote some of the most innovative and important books in economics, the social sciences, and the history of ideas. Throughout, he remained committed to his belief that reform is possible, even in the darkest of times. This is the first major account of Hirschman's remarkable life, and a tale of the twentieth century as seen through the story of an astute and passionate observer. Adelman's riveting narrative traces how Hirschman's personal experiences shaped his unique intellectual perspective, and how his enduring legacy is one of hope, open-mindedness, and practical idealism.",

For intellectuals, the peripheral situation is a crisis situation in which their social location loses its autonomy vis-a-vis the world system. The changing pattern of this crisis (mapped out with qualitative &amp; quantitative data) has occured in five identifiable phases: (1) the rise of Muslim nationalism, culminating in the partition of India in 1947; (2) language controversy &amp; the quest for secular-cultural identity, highlighted by the language movement of 1952; (3) unequal development &amp; the struggle for economic &amp; political autonomy in the 1960s; (4) the War of Independence &amp; birth of Bangladesh in 1971; &amp; (5) integration of Bangladesh into the world system after 1971.",

If the intellectual has long been defined in the Marxian-Gramscian tradition as a social actor with a special praxical investment in ways and forms of knowing, then what we discuss as 'intellectualism,' the social formation of knowledge, should be understood as a central dimension of the (re)production of nations and nationalism both inside and outside of states. We suggest that further drawing anthropological attention to intellectuals and their knowledge practices (ranging from the poetic-literary to the technical-administrative) will help the anthropology of nations and nationalism to (a) locate the role of human agency in the creation, circulation, and contestation of national culture, (b) capture the intellectual work involved in nationalism and bureaucracy in its full diversity, and (c) imagine a new series of ethnographic access points among educated professionals for the study of nationalism in action.",

This new level of visualization within the fictive space of representation indirectly reflects contemporary attempts to exclude poveri and other undesirables from the actual space of the city. Increased state involvement in poor relief stimulated a new iconography of secular charity featuring almsgiving by patrician officials, presented in an hierarchical manner that pointedly departs from the more communal depictions in paintings commissioned by the city's non-noble scuole. But it was in religious painting for the city's churches and monasteries that the visual imagery of poverty was most dramatically improved, with reference both to sacred and devotional texts stressing poverty as a sacred value and to formal models from antique and High Renaissance art. The povero increasingly appeared as an idealized human archetype whose suffering and humility associated him directly with Christ. The article concludes by arguing that the symbolization of the poor as significant sacred actors in visual art was an aspect of their repression and exclusion in the social domain.",

Through a detailed examination of the significant intellectual, spiritual, and ideological developments across Europe during this period, Levi disputes the discontinuities commonly understood to explain and defend the events we term the \"Renaissance\" and the \"Reformation.\" He argues that the renewed cult of the literary, visual, and educational norms of classical antiquity were a consequence-not the essence or cause-of the Renaissance. Further, the Reformation emerged from a cultural movement that neither constituted a historical discontinuity nor led to the catastrophic religious clashes of the sixteenth century. To construct his argument Levi analyzes intellectual developments reflected in the works of Petrarch, Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, Thomas More, Luther, Erasmus, Calvin, and many others. In addition he considers the full sweep of issues relating to the gestation of the Renaissance and Reformation, among them the political and financial consequences of the emergence of the large nation states, their attitudes toward the papacy, the evolving relationship between sacred and secular sovereign powers, and the norms informing the development of Europe's legal systems and its religious sensibilities.",

Both systematic and conscious obfuscation of scriptural categories as well as complex but predictable patterns of dissimulation extending over virtually all types of cultural and social discourse--the caste-system, \"superstitions,\" the \"scientific\" base of Hinduism, political talk, etc., are adduced and investigated as paradigms of contemporary Indian parlance, which is not the grass-roots idiom, but which is gathering momentum as the forensic instrument of India's leadership and of Indian administrators, educators, and the Indian intellectuals.",

And will it therefore join the movement of market fundamentalism that, in many Western societies, has abandoned social housing, emancipatory education and public space for the exclusive game of high profitability investments and upper-class ideology-formation, in which the beautification of run-down urban neighbourhoods plays a leading role? Or are we witnessing a revival of popular culture that will contribute to the integration of excluded groups within the social fabric? This special feature examines these questions, always central ones for City, and explains how strategies to democratize culture offer solutions for the paradoxes (insurmountable contradictions, as the capitalist class would argue) of the workfare state and urban renewal policies. The feature flows from an event organized in Bruges as a challenge and a critique to the city's year as 'Cultural Capital of Europe' and includes contributions from artists, local historians and activists, a schoolteacher and scholars from the universities.

In the new millennium, the government has envisioned a new role for the city-state as a 'Renaissance City' and 'Global City for the Arts'. This vision is premised on Singapore becoming an investment base for leading arts, cultural and entertainment enterprises in the region, the theatre hub of Southeast Asia, and an entertainment destination for tourists. This article examines the challenges and accomplishments in Singapore's quest to be a Renaissance City. Drawing on Literature on 'global cities' and concepts relating to 'globalization' and 'localization', it argues that the key challenge facing Singapore is how best to 'go global' and 'stay local' at the same time. Developing a Renaissance City entails a balancing act between globalizing local sensibilities on the one hand, while localizing global best-practices on the other. This global-local nexus can be approached in three ways: (1) by striking a balance between the economic and humanistic objectives of the arts; (2) by importing world-class arts talents and exporting home-grown skills; and (3) by globalizing local peculiarities in line with best practices from around the world. The need to balance global standards with local interests is not easily achieved, however, making Singapore's 'Global City for the Arts' vision one of its most ambitious goals to date.",

Relatively traditional depictions of strong males and restrained females began to recur with the return to political stability and social normalcy after the Peace of Bologna.

Nevertheless, despite fierce academic debate about whether or not gentrification leads to displacement, segregation and social polarisation, it is increasingly promoted in policy circles both in Europe and North America on the assumption that it will lead to less segregated and more sustainable communities. Yet there is a poor evidence base for this policy of 'positive gentrification'-for, as the gentrification literature tells us, despite the new middle classes' desire for diversity and difference they tend to self-segregate and, far from being tolerant, gentrification is part of an aggressive, revanchist ideology designed to retake the inner city for the middle classes. In light of this, it is argued that these new policies of social mixing require critical attention with regard to their ability to produce an inclusive urban renaissance and the potentially detrimental gentrifying effects they may inflict on the communities they intend to help.",

In this magisterial work, Goldthwaite brings together a lifetime of research and insight on the subject, clarifying and explaining the complex workings of Florence's commercial, banking, and artisan sectors. Florence was one of the most industrialized cities in medieval Europe, thanks to its thriving textile industries. The importation of raw materials and the exportation of finished cloth necessitated the creation of commercial and banking practices that extended far beyond Florence's boundaries. Part I situates Florence within this wider international context and describes the commercial and banking networks through which the city's merchant-bankers operated. Part II focuses on the urban economy of Florence itself, including various industries, merchants, artisans, and investors. It also evaluates the role of government in the economy, the relationship of the urban economy to the region, and the distribution of wealth throughout the society.While political, social, and cultural histories of Florence abound, none focuses solely on the economic history of the city. The Economy of Renaissance Florence offers both a systematic description of the city's major economic activities and a comprehensive overview of its economic development from the late Middle Ages through the Renaissance to 1600.",

There is a longstanding fascination with the fact that some professors during the Renaissance had extremely high salaries. It has been suggested that at the top of the salary scale were the superstars, professors who could attract many students and raise the prestige of the university. Through an analysis of data on the salaries of professors at Padua in 1422&ndash;1423, I argue that much of the differences in salaries can be explained in terms of the stage of career of professors. Those professors who have taught the longest tend to be paid the most. Hence, there is little evidence for the superstar thesis.",

              "description":"Before the age of multimedia, how did the invention of a new technology affect the careers of Renaissance artists? In this groundbreaking book Evelyn Lincoln examines the formation of the new career of printmaker during the late fifteenth century and throughout the sixteenth century in Italy. She focuses particularly on the practical relationship between the ancient skill of drawing and the more modern techniques of artisans who made prints by engraving images into copper or wood. Looking closely at the widely diverse prints issuing from early Italian presses, Lincoln shows how Italian social, religious, and educational practices are revealed in these printed images, demonstrating how the printmaker's training and experience affected the look of the finished work.Lincoln builds her discussion around the work of three printmakers practicing at different times and under varying economic opportunities and restraints: Andrea Mantegna in Mantua, Domenico Beccafumi in Siena, and Diana Mantuana (Diana Scultori),in Rome. She shows how the occupational origins of early printmakers and publishers affected how they thought about the functions of multiple images. This account of their work -- at powerful courts, in a small republic, and in a cosmopolitan city -- sets the prints in the context of related paintings, sculpture, and architecture, describing a period when printmaking opened up new ways to make a living and transformed the mechanisms of Renaissance visual culture.",

              "description":"A major, path-breaking work, History, Medicine, and the Traditions of Renaissance Learning is Nancy G. Siraisi's examination into the intersections of medically trained authors and history in the period 1450 to 1650. Rather than studying medicine and history as separate disciplinary traditions, Siraisi calls attention to their mutual interaction in the rapidly changing world of Renaissance erudition. Far from their contributions being a mere footnote in the historical record, medical writers had extensive involvement in the reading, production, and shaping of historical knowledge during this important period. With remarkably detailed scholarship, Siraisi investigates doctors' efforts to explore the legacies handed down to them from ancient medical and anatomical writings and the difficult reconciliations this required between the authority of the ancient world and the discoveries of the modern. She also studies the ways in which sixteenth-century medical authors wrote history, both in their own medical texts and in more general historical works. In the course of her study, Siraisi finds that what allowed medical writers to become so fully engaged in the writing of history was their general humanistic background, their experience of history through the field of medicine's past, and the tools that the writing of history offered to the development of a rapidly evolving profession. Nancy G. Siraisi is one of the preeminent scholars of medieval and Renaissance intellectual history, specializing in medicine and science. Now Distinguished Professor Emerita of History at Hunter College and the Graduate Center, City University of New York, and a 2008 winner of a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, she has written numerous books, including Taddeo Alderotti and His Pupils (Princeton, 1981), which won the American Association for the History of Medicine William H. Welch Medal; Avicenna in Renaissance Italy (Princeton, 1987); The Clock and the Mirror (Princeton, 1997); and the widely used textbook Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine (Chicago, 1990), which won the Watson Davis and Helen Miles Davis Prize from the History of Science Society. In 2003 Siraisi received the History of Science Society's George Sarton Medal, in 2004 she received the Paul Oskar Kristellar Award for Lifetime Achievement of the Renaissance Society of America, and in 2005 she was awarded the American Historical Association Award for Scholarly Distinction.\"A fascinating study of Renaissance physicians as avid readers and enthusiastic writers of all kinds of history: from case narratives and medical biographies to archaeological and environmental histories. In this wide-ranging book, Nancy Siraisi demonstrates the deep links between the medical and the humanistic disciplines in early modern Europe.\"---Katharine Park, Zemurray Stone Radcliffe Professor of the History of Science, Harvard University\"This is a salient but little explored aspect of Renaissance humanism, and there is no doubt that Siraisi has succeeded in throwing light onto a vast subject. The scholarship is wide-ranging and profound, and breaks new ground. The choice of examples is fascinating, and it puts Renaissance documents into a new context. This is a major book, well written, richly learned and with further implications for more than students of medical history.\"---Vivian Nutton, Professor, The Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine, University College London, and author of From Democedes to Harvey: Studies in the History of Medicine\"Siraisi shows the many-dimensioned overlaps and interactions between medicine and 'history' in the early modern period, marking a pioneering effort to survey a neglected discipline. Her book follows the changing usage of the classical term 'history' both as empiricism and as a kind of scholarship in the Renaissance before its more modern analytical and critical applications. It is a marvel of erudition in an area insufficiently studied.\"---Donald R. Kelley, Emeritus James Westfall Thompson Professor of History, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, and Executive Editor of Journal of the History of Ideas",

              "description":"During the sixteenth-century, Venice was the setting for some of the most admired churches in the whole western canon, while major advances in the sophistication, richness and religious expression of choral polyphony led to pioneering developments in the evolution of stereophonic sound. Printing and publishing brought a sudden acceleration in the spread of knowledge - theoretical, practical and scientific - and speeded up the reproduction of musical scores. The intense scrutiny of religious liturgy enacted during the Counter Reformation led to further reflection on the character and performance of religious music. The focus of this fascinating study is the direct relationship between architectural design and sacred music in Renaissance Venice. The designs of two of the greatest architects of the Italian Renaissance, Sansovino and Palladio, are seen against the background of the innovative polyphonic choral music in split-choir formation (coro spezzato), pioneered in St Mark's by the Flemish musician Adrian Willaert and disseminated as a result of the rapid development of music printing in Venice. Later composers refined and elaborated these innovations, which culminated in the innovative sacred music of Monteverdi. The needs of elaborate state ceremonial stimulated the demand for musical virtuosity and imposing architectural settings, but the innovations filtered down to affect music in the simplest parish churches. The book combines historical research into the architectural and liturgical traditions of a dozen Venetian churches with the results of a parallel series of scientific surveys of the acoustic properties of the chosen buildings. The research culminated in a programme of in situ choral experiments and acoustic measurements, carried out in Venice using the celebrated choir of St John's College, Cambridge, in 2007, revealing the strong awareness of acoustic effects on the part of architects, musicians, patrons and churchmen of the Renaissance period.
